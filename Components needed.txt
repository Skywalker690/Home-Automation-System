1. ESP8266 (NodeMCU)


2. Relay Module (for controlling appliances)


3. LED or any appliance for demo (as an output device)


4. Jumper wires


5. Power supply



Project Overview:

This project will allow you to control a light or appliance by accessing a web server hosted by the ESP8266 over Wi-Fi. The appliance can be switched ON/OFF from the browser.

Wiring:

1. ESP8266 to Relay Module

D1 (GPIO5) to Relay IN1

VCC to 3.3V

GND to GND



2. Relay Module to LED/Appliance

One terminal of the LED/appliance to NO (Normally Open)

Other terminal of the LED/appliance to GND or Power (based on your setup)
