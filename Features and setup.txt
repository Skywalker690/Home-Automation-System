This Arduino project uses an ESP8266 (NodeMCU) to create a simple home automation system. It allows control of appliances over Wi-Fi using a web server hosted by the ESP8266.

## Features:
- Control relay (for lights, fans, etc.) over Wi-Fi using a web interface.
- Simple HTML-based interface.
- Easy to set up.


## Setup:
1. Connect the ESP8266 to the relay as described in the wiring section of the code.
2. Upload the Arduino code to the ESP8266.
3. Open the Serial Monitor to find the IP address of the ESP8266.
4. Open the IP address in a browser to control the appliance.
